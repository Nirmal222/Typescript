- Typescript is the superset of javascript
- It helps you write good code by throwing runtime errors
- It is all about the type of safety
    - Ex: 2+”2”=”22” - This is a JS behavior that is not conventional.
- The job of typescript is to check static checking
- It is a transpiler which at the end of the day converts the code to Javascript
